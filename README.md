# Credit-Bureau-Project
The bureau report of some customers is in XML format and has information of historical trade experience; inquiries that they have made for loan requests. Trade experience includes information such as loan amount taken by them, loan disbursed date, date of report when their information is reported in the bureau and others information such as their payment DPD status and months. DPD is days past due during his EMI duration. For example if a customer doesn’t repay their emi for more than 30 days after their given repayment date, then it is said that a customer has gone 30+dpd.  The report has information about multiple trades according to the customer’s trade types (eg:-Business Loan, Personal Loan ,etc.), disbursed date, disbursed amount etc. For each single trade you will have Disbursed Amount (loan amount) a customer has taken for that loan (eg-100000(Disbursed Amount) for Business Loan(Account Type) on 01-06-2011(Disbursed date) and for each trade you will have his payment history of that particular loan that has his/her DPD value, status and month for which he has to pay back his EMI.
